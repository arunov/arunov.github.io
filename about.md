My name is Arun Vasudevan and I work at [Nutanix](https://www.nutanix.com).
This site is to capture my learnings and interesting stuff that I want to refer
back from time to time. I have been inspired by [the morning
paper](https://blog.acolyer.org) to start on this journey. (Let's see how long
it goes :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).
